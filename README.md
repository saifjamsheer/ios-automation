# Text2XML
### Automatic XML Generatior

Automates the process of formatting a text file to an xml layout. The tool checks each line in the text file for any potential errors and if there are none, 
a strings.xml file can be populated with the formatted strings - the tool will then automatically overwrite any preexisting string.xml file. In the case of one 
or more errors, the user will be informed of these errors and the lines they are located in.
